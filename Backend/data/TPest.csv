Safflower,Aphid,10,28,40,60,"Cultural control: If the attack is observed in the border rows take control measures Intercultural operations such as harrowing and hoeing reduce weeds such as Parthenium hysterophorus in safflower field which serve as alternate hosts for safflower aphids.Intercropping with sorghum, wheat and coriander reduces aphid infestation Intercropping with niger should be avoided"
Sunflower,Alternaria leaf spot,25,27,NA,,Cultural control: Early planting during kharif escapes from the leaf spot Occurrence and severity of the disease depend on the season and planting dates. Mid-September planting of sunflower remains free from most of the major diseases including Alternaria. Intercropping of sunflower with groundnut in the ratio of 6:2 reduces leafspot. Spacing of 60 x 30cm or 45 x 30cm is optimum in reducing the buildup of leaf spot
Sunflower,Downy mildew,16,18,80,95,"Cultural control:Use downy mildew resistant hybrids LSH-1 and LSH-3 for endemic pockets of Maharastra. Most of the recently released hybrids viz., BSH-1, KBSH-1, MSFH-17, DSH-1, SPIC-105 are resistant to downy mildew. Remove volunteer sunflower plants, Parthenium weed around the field and clean cultivation. Shollow sowing (3 cm) is desirable to avoid downy mildew. Pre sowing irrigation followed by one irrigation at 10 or more days after sowing reduces disease Roguing of mildew infected seedlings during thinning, removal and destruction of infected plants. Crop rotation in sunflower with groundnut/ sorghum/ pigeonpea for six-years. "
Potato,Late blight,7.2,26.6,80,95,Cultural control: Use short-duration varieties. The model specifies that 7 days moving sum of RH > 85% for at least 90 hr coupled with a 7 day moving sum of temperature between 7.2 and 26.6°C for at least 115 hr would predict appearance of late blight within 10 days of satisfying the conditions.
